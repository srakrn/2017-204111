# Fibonacci recurrences counting

## Observing fibonacci running time

Do a call with `sys.args` for the desired fibonacci value.

```
python3 fibonacci_recursion.py 10
```

The executed time will be show in (brackets).

## Plotting fibonacci running time

Run `plot.py` for the fibonacci running time plot. You can change the functions to be imported by editing line 4 of the code.

(This is bad, but I have no intentions to edit this code, as a Jupyter Notebook was served with full-functional demonstration.)
